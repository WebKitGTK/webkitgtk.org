CVE-2021-42762:
  author: an anonymous reporter
  version: 2.34.1
  description: 'BubblewrapLauncher.cpp allows a limited sandbox bypass that allows
    a sandboxed process to trick host processes into thinking the sandboxed process
    is not confined by the sandbox, by abusing VFS syscalls that manipulate its filesystem
    namespace. The impact is limited to host services that create UNIX sockets that
    WebKit mounts inside its sandbox, and the sandboxed process remains otherwise
    confined. NOTE: this is similar to CVE-2021-41133'
