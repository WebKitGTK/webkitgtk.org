CVE-2020-13753:
  author: Milan Crha at Red Hat
  version:
    gtk: 2.28.3
    wpe: 2.28.3
  description: The bubblewrap sandbox of WebKitGTK and WPE WebKit, prior to 2.28.3,
    failed to properly block access to CLONE_NEWUSER and the TIOCSTI ioctl. CLONE_NEWUSER
    could potentially be used to confuse xdg-desktop-portal, which allows access outside
    the sandbox. TIOCSTI can be used to directly execute commands outside the sandbox
    by writing to the controlling terminal's input buffer, similar to CVE-2017-5226.
