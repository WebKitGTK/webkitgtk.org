CVE-2022-2294:
  author: Jan Vojtesek of Avast Threat Intelligence team.
  version: 2.36.5
  description: "Heap buffer overflow in LibWebRTC allowed a remote attacker to potentially
    exploit heap corruption via a crafted HTML page. NOTE: The tarballs of WebKitGTK
    or WPE WebKit don't ship LibWebRTC. Also the LibWebRTC support is disabled by
    default. You only are affected by this vulnerability if your build enabled the
    USE_LIBWEBRTC CMake option and used the repository as source instead of the tarballs."
