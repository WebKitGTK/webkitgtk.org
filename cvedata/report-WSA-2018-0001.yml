CVE-2017-5753:
  author: Jann Horn of Google Project Zero; and Paul Kocher in collaboration with
    Daniel Genkin of University of Pennsylvania and University of Maryland, Daniel
    Gruss of Graz University of Technology, Werner Haas of Cyberus Technology, Mike
    Hamburg of Rambus (Cryptography Research Division), Moritz Lipp of Graz University
    of Technology, Stefan Mangard of Graz University of Technology, Thomas Prescher
    of Cyberus Technology, Michael Schwarz of Graz University of Technology, and Yuval
    Yarom of University of Adelaide and Data61
  version: 2.18.5
  description: Security improvements are included to mitigate the effects.
  impact: Systems with microprocessors utilizing speculative execution and branch
    prediction may allow unauthorized disclosure of information to an attacker via
    a side-channel analysis. This variant of the Spectre vulnerability triggers the
    speculative execution by performing a bounds-check bypass.
