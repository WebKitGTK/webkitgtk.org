title: WebKitGTK 2.38.6 released!
---

This is a bug fix release in the stable 2.38 series.

### What's new in the WebKitGTK 2.38.6 release?

 - Enable the Asynchronous Clipboard API to make certain pages work
   (e.g. GithHub started recently requiring it).
 - Support :has() CSS selectors in content filters.
 - Apply basic font properties as font variation settings.
 - The Bubblewrap sandbox no longer requires setting an application
   identifier via GApplication to operate correctly. Using GApplication
   is still recommended, but optional.
 - Improvements to the GStreamer multimedia playback, in particular
   around MSE, WebRTC, and seeking.
 - Fix the build with journald support enabled when using elogind
   instead of the systemd libraries.
 - Fix the build with Link-Time Optimization enabled (-flto=auto).
 - Fix context menus not working in the remote Web Inspector.
 - Fix usage of the remote Web Inspector over HTTP.
 - Fix debug logs not being emitted in release builds.
 - Fix several crashes and rendering issues.

Thanks to all the contributors who made possible this release.
