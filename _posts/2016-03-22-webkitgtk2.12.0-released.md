---

This is the first stable release in the 2.12 series.

### Highlights of the WebKitGTK+ 2.12.0 release

 - Enable FTL by default in JavaScriptCore for x86_64.
 - Network process is now used unconditionally. The shared secondary process model is now
   the same as using the multiple process model and setting a process limit of 1.
 - Switch to use overlay scrollbars like all other GTK+ widgets and ensure the behavior
   is consistent with GTK+ too.
 - Support for windowless NPAPI plugins with no UI in non X11 platforms.
 - Enable GSS-Negotiate support when available in libsoup.
 - Improved general performance by better handling glib main loop sources.
 - New API to save and restore a WebView session.
