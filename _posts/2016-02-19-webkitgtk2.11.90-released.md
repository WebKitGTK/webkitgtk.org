title: WebKitGTK+ 2.11.90 released!
---

This is a development release leading toward 2.12 series.

### What's new in the WebKitGTK+ 2.11.90 release?

 - Switch to use overlay scrollbars like all other GTK+ widgets and ensure the behavior
   is consistent with GTK+ too.
 - Limit the number of tiles according to the visible area. This was causing a huge memory
   consumption with some websites.
 - Fix toggle buttons rendering with GTK+ 3.19.
 - Fix HTTP authentication dialog rendering when accelerated compositing mode is enabled.
 - Use G_TYPE_ERROR instead of G_TYPE_POINTER for GError parameters of signals.
 - Fix several memory leaks.

Thanks to all the contributors who made possible this release.
