This is a bug fix release in the stable 2.4 series.

### What's new in the WebKitGTK+ 2.4.3 release?

 - Fix video playback rate used when resuming in GStreamer media backend.
 - Use GstMetaVideo as announced by WebKitVideoSink to fix some
   decoders and filters that rely on buffer's meta rather that in the
   caps structures.
 - Do not pass a valid pointer as redirected-response parameter to
   WebKitWebPage::send-request signal when not redirecting.
 - Add missing files to the build required for building in Windows.

Thanks to all the contributors who made possible this release.
