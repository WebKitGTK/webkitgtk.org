title: WebKitGTK 2.38.4 released!
---

This is a bug fix release in the stable 2.38 series.

### What's new in the WebKitGTK 2.38.4 release?

 - Improve GStreamer multimedia playback across the board with improved
   codec selection logic, better handling of latency, and improving
   frame discard to avoid audio/video desynchronization, among other
   fixes.
 - Disable HLS media playback by default, which makes web sites use MSE
   instead. If needed `WEBKIT_GST_ENABLE_HLS_SUPPORT=1` can be set in the
   environment to enable it back.
 - Disable threaded rendering in GTK4 builds by default, as it was
   causing crashes.
 - Fix MediaSession API not showing artwork images.
 - Fix MediaSession MPRIS usage when running inside a Flatpak sandbox.
 - Fix input element controls to correctly scale when applying a zoom
   factor different than the default.
 - Fix leakage of Web processes in certain situations.
 - Fix the injected bundle not being found when running inside a sandbox.
 - Fix the build with `ENABLE_INTROSPECTION` when cross-compiling.
 - FIx the build with `ENABLE_WEBGL` disabled.
 - Fix the build with GStreamer-based WebRTC enabled.
 - Fix the build with `USE_GTK4` enabled.
 - Fix several crashes and rendering issues.

Thanks to all the contributors who made possible this release.
