title: WebKitGTK+ 2.1.90.1 released!
---

This is a development release leading toward 2.2 series.

### What's new in the WebKitGTK+ 2.1.90.1 release?

 - Adds support for maintainer mode, so that the GNOME continuous
   integration will be able to forbid autotools regeneration
 - Added DOM bindings symbols that got removed from the IDL back for
   ABI compatibility

Thanks to all the contributors who made possible this release.
