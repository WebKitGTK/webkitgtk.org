title: WebKitGTK+ 2.7.1 released!
---

This is the first development release leading toward 2.8 series.

### What's new in the WebKitGTK+ 2.7.1 release?

 - Add initial gestures support. For now only drag, zoom and tap
   gestures are supported, but it's enough ot make WebKitGTK+ usable
   in touch screens. It requires GTK+ 3.14.
 - Add webkit_hit_test_result_context_is_selection().
 - The Web Inspector now uses a separate Web Process.
 - Add implementation of subtle crypto HMAC and digest algorithms.

Thanks to all the contributors who made possible this release.
