title: WebKitGTK 2.36.3 released!
---

This is a bug fix release in the stable 2.36 series.

### What's new in the WebKitGTK 2.36.3 release?

 - Support capturing already encoded video streams, which takes advantage
   of encoding done in hardware by devices which support this feature.
 - Avoid using experimental GStreamer elements for video demuxing.
 - Avoid using the legacy GStreamer VA-API decoding plug-ins, which often
   cause rendering issues and are not much maintained. Their usage can be
   re-enabled setting `WEBKIT_GST_ENABLE_LEGACY_VAAPI=1` in the environment.
 - Fix playback of YouTube streams which use dynamic ad insertion.
 - Fix display capture with Pipewire.
 - Fix the build without the X11 target when X11 headers are not present.
 - Fix several crashes and rendering issues.

Thanks to all the contributors who made possible this release.
