title: WebKitGTK+ 2.15.4 released!
---

This is a development release leading toward 2.16 series.

### What's new in the WebKitGTK+ 2.15.4 release?

 - Make accelerating compositing mode on-demand again. By default it will only be used for websites
   that require it, saving a lot of memory on websites that don't need it.
 - Add API to manage hardware acceleration policy.
 - Enable CSS Grid Layout by default.
 - Add API to create ephemeral WebViews to replace the legacy private browsing setting that is now
   deprecated.
 - Handle HTTP authentication for downloads having a WebView associated.
 - Add API to WebKitWebsiteDataManager to handle websites data.
 - Fix BadDamage X errors happening when resizing the WebView.
 - Fix several crashes and rendering issues.

Thanks to all the contributors who made possible this release.
