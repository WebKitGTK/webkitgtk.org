title: WebKitGTK+ 2.2.6 released!
---

This is a bug fix release in the stable 2.2 series.

### What's new in the WebKitGTK+ 2.2.6 release?

 - Fix infinite loop in WebProcess due to a race condition that can
   happen when the socket event source is cancelled.
 - Use a persistent cache for plugins metadata to avoid blocking the
   UI while scanning plugins during page loads.
 - Make sure the web process doesn't finish if there's an ongoing
   print operation.
 - Fix web process leak when the WebView is leaked by the
   application.
 - Fix the generation of g_return macros for GObject DOM bindings in
   some cases where non pointer parameters were handled as pointers.

Thanks to all the contributors who made possible this release.
