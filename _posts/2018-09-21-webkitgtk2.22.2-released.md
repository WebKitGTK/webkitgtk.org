title: WebKitGTK+ 2.22.2 released!
---

This is a bug fix release in the stable 2.22 series.

### What's new in the WebKitGTK+ 2.22.2 release?

 - Several fixes for video playback with media source extensions (MSE).
   This allows using WebM support for YouTube, which no longer works through
   regular video source. Note that MSE is still disabled by default and
   webkit_settings_set_enable_mediasource() has to be used to enable the
   feature.
 - Fix the build when only Wayland support is enabled and X11 headers are
   not available.

Thanks to all the contributors who made possible this release.
