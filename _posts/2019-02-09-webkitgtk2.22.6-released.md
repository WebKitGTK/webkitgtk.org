---

This is a bug fix release in the stable 2.22 series.

### What's new in the WebKitGTK+ 2.22.6 release?

 - Make kinetic scrolling slow down smoothly when reaching the ends of
   pages, instead of abruptly, to better match the GTK+ behaviour.
 - Fix Web inspector magnifier under Wayland.
 - Fix garbled rendering of some websites (e.g. YouTube) while scrolling
   under X11.
 - Fix several crashes, race conditions, and rendering issues.

Thanks to all the contributors who made possible this release.
