title: WebKitGTK+ 2.19.5 released!
---

This is a development release leading toward 2.20 series.

### What's new in the WebKitGTK+ 2.19.5 release?

 - This is a follow up release to export webkit_dom_dom_window_webkit_message_handlers_post_message() symbol that
   was hidden in 2.19.4 by mistake.

Thanks to all the contributors who made possible this release.
