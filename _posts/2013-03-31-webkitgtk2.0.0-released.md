title: WebKitGTK+ 2.0.0 released!
---

This is the first stable release in the 2.0 series.

WebKitGTK+ 2.0.0 includes both the WebKit1 and WebKit2 APIs and are
built by default. The WebKit2 API is now considered stable from the
API/ABI backwards compatibility point of view. The WebKit1 API is in
maintenance mode, we will continue fixing bugs but we don't plan to add
new API.


### What's new in the WebKitGTK+ 2.0.0 release? ###

- Fix clip region of windowed plugins in WebKit2.
- Fix compile warning in WebKit2 unit tests.
- Fix the build with Python 3.

Thanks to all the contributors who made possible this release, they
are far too many to list!
