title: WebKitGTK+ 2.1.92 released!
---

This is a development release leading toward 2.2 series.

### What's new in the WebKitGTK+ 2.1.92 release?

 - Switch to the new Web Inspector.
 - Reimplement several accessibility methods to not require Gail and
   Pango.
 - Allow to run in a Wayland environment even when WebKitGTK+ has
   been built with accelerated compositing support enabled, falling
   back to software rendering in such case since accelerated
   compositing is not supported yet under Wayland.
 - Enable the Wayland target by default if the GTK+ Wayland
   dependency is available.
 - Fix web inspector rendering when docked in a page that uses
   accelerated compositing.
 - Do not try to parse incomplete HTTP requests in the web inspector.
 - Use WEBKIT_TYPE_DOWNLOAD instead of G_TYPE_OBJECT for the argument
   of the WebKitWebView::download-requested signal in WebKit1.
 - Add allow-none introspection annotation to parameters that can
   be NULL in GObject DOM bindings.
 - Honor the --disable-gtk-doc configure option.
 - Fix the build on directories containing spaces.
 - Allow to build when the build directory is in a different
   partition.
 - Translation updates: Polish, Brazilian Portuguese, Spanish, Galician

Thanks to all the contributors who made possible this release.
