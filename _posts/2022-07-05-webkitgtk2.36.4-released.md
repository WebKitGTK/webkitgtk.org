This is a bug fix release in the stable 2.36 series.

### What's new in the WebKitGTK 2.36.4 release?

 - Fix the new ATSPI accessibility implementation to add the missing
   Collection interface for the loaded document.

   sandbox friendly, which plays better with Flatpak and WebKit's own
   Bubblwrap-based sandboxing.
 - Fix leaked Web Processes in some particular situations.
 - Fix the build with media capture support enabled.
 - Fix cross-compilation when targeting 64-bit ARM.
