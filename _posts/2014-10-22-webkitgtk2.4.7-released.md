This is a bug fix release in the stable 2.4 series.

### What's new in the WebKitGTK+ 2.4.7 release?

 - Fix the remote web inspector.
 - Fix rendering of buttons, selections and lists with recent GTK+
   versions.
 - Fix the build with drag and drop support disabled.
 - Fix the build with video support disabled.
 - Fix a crash in the plugin process with some windowed flash plugins.
 - TLS errors now take precedence over the HTTP authentication dialog.
 - Do not shrink on-disk cache to its default size on startup.
 - Don't include full path names in WebKitEnumTypes.h to ensure the
